# ProblemSolving_2026

Hey there! 👋 

This is my personal repository where I'll be sharing the problems I solve throughout the entire year of 2026. My goal is to stay consistent and improve my problem-solving skills across various platforms.

## What's Inside?
I'll be cataloging my solutions from:
- **LeetCode**
- **Codeforces**
- **HackerRank**
- and more!

## Structure
Each problem has its own home:
- `README.md`: The problem description and constraints.
- `solution.py`: My implementation in Python.
- `Solution.java`: My implementation in Java.

Happy coding! 🚀
